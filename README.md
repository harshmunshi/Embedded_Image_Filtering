## Benchmarking Image Filtering Tasks For Embedded Deployment

This is an effort under construction. Trying to benchmark according to various parameters is a challenging task. Here are some list of the tasks that are planned ahead

- [ ] Writing custom image loader and manipulator.
- [ ] Writing a simple sobel filter consisting as matrix of `int`.
- [ ] Benchmarking pixel values as standard `int`.
- [ ] Benchmarking `int` based initialization with multithreading.
- [ ] Added benchmarking on `uint8_t` with/without multithreading.
- [ ] Added support for RGB images.
